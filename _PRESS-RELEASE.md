There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  The Conway's Game of Life Applet.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Anyone who enjoys seeing how very simple rules and part can interact and see complexity emerge.  The
  benefit is entertainment and joy when click a bunch of random squares/circles on a boardgame template
  react with each other in totally unexpected ways.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  This 'game' is example of axiomatic based simulation of 'life.' I say 'game' because you can't win, or lose you just learn new things about how the game interacts with itself and the user.  I say 'life' because this is highly simplified.  The board is setup something like a chess/checker board with tiles. Which we will call cells. When you click a cell you put living cell there.  If the cells surrounding the live cell add up to be less than 2 he will die of lonliness.  If the cells surrounding the live cell are greater than 3 he will die of overpopulation. If there are exactly three neighbors in an empty cell, create life there. A simple example is a 2x2 square, if nothing else interacts with this square it is self-sustaining.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Can you imagine having to write the equations or visualizations on paper? No thanks, we will solve that problem right here, right now.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Now imagine you have a beautiful, crisp deplay on your screen where you can test out new ideas, or just try random patterns to see that place between simplicity, complexity, and serendipty 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Entrancing. Takes a minute to get used to, but it can be totally engaging and zen at the same time."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just click a few cells and click step/run!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I love seeing what can happen by clicking a few cells and letting the pattern iteratate over and over again."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
